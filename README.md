# Wave Industries

Here at wave industries we strive for the best in IoT Vessel statistics and predictive maintance.
We aim to do statistical analysis of ships in Norway as our preliminary research, but aim to expand this techonology worldwide.
This analysis gives easy access for remote monitoring for land based operator stations.
The access to historical data could lead to more effective ways of doing predictive maintenance.
This does adopt a big data perspective of data analysis, and therefore has huge potential for future statistical analysis.

## The problem
Efficeny and environmental impact, the main target for wave industries.
Effecency of ships, is a significant part of CO2 .
Environmental impact assesment can be both costly and time-consuming.


## The Solution 
With our proposed solution we aim to hit a more efficent shipping industry. 
Wave introduces Management consoles for both the engineering teams and management teams.
Connecting ships together with new technology could lead to a more Economic and efficant shipping industry.
